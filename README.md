Aerosol and Surface Stability of SARS-CoV-2 as Compared with SARS-CoV-1


<p style = "font-family:Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', 'DejaVu Serif', Georgia, 'serif'">In this experiment scientists measured how long and how infectious 2 strains of the coronavirus (SARS Cov-1 and SARS Cov-2) were on 5 different type of environments (Aerosols, plastic, stainless steel, copper and cardboard). Infectivity was measured via 10^5.25 50% tissue-culture infectious dose (TCID50). For aerosol both SARS Cov-1 and SARS Cov-2 remained infectious for about 3 hours and had a TCID50 value that started at 10^4 and ended at 10^3. The rest of the surfaces remained infectious for 72 hours but some dropped under a TCID50 value of 10^2 more quickly than others. For copper both strains dropped under 10^2 after about 5 hours making it the hardest surface for either strain to grow on. For cardboard SARS Cov-2 dropped under 10^2 after 10 hours but SARS Cov-1 dropped under 10^2 in 3 hours. For stainless steel both strains took about 20 hours and for plastic both strains also took about 20 hours.</p>
